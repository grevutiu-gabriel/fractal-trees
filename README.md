Fractal trees in C++

I have always been fascinated by beautiful graphics and animation. I came across this 
[super cool video by Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU) a weeks ago and decided to build it in C++ without using any frameworks.

The program uses Bresenham's line algorithm to draw the approximation of a line. It also uses basic 
high school vector geometry.

Here is are few samples:

[Branching at 10 degree](Tree1.ppm)

[Branching at 30 degree](Tree2.ppm)

[Branching at 50 degree](Tree3.ppm)
